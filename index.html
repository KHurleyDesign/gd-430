    <h2>Week One</h2>
    <p>Homework</p>
    <p> These are the resources that I found the most helpful when I was learning and reaserching css grid</P>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="www.lynda.com">Lynda</a> Responsive layout with Clarissa Peterson
        <li>Sitting at two and a half hours this tutorial video is extremely comprehensive in the topics that it covers
            for
            making responsive layouts. It covers basic concepts like inline/block elements, absolute/relative/fixed
            positioning
            to the more intricate and specifics of css grid and flexbox. What i found to be the most helpful was its
            sections
            on units and media queries. Although it is a time commitment I would highly recommend the video. </li>
