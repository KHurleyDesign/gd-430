    <h2>Week One</h2>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <p> These are the resources that I found the most helpful when I was learning and reaserching css grid</P>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="www.lynda.com">Lynda</a> Responsive layout with Clarissa Peterson
            <ul>
                <li>Sitting at two and a half hours this tutorial video is extremely comprehensive in the topics that
                    it covers
                    for
                    making responsive layouts. It covers basic concepts like inline/block elements,
                    absolute/relative/fixed
                    positioning
                    to the more intricate and specifics of css grid and flexbox. What i found to be the most helpful
                    was its
                    sections
                    on units and media queries. Although it is a time commitment I would highly recommend the video.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://cssreference.io/">cssreference</a>
            <ul>
                <li>This site offers visual examples as well as definitions/explanations of various properties in css
                    grid. Although it
                    is not explicitly a tutorial it offers a large depth of easily digestible information on the topic.
                    The site also
                    have other collections of information such as flexbox and animations

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://cssgridgarden.com//">Grid Garden</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Grid Garden is a fun and playful way to review concepts related to css grid. This game leads you
                    through various
                    fundamental elements of css grid starting generic then building into complex examples. This was
                    helpful to me
                    because it removes the pressure of designing something “perfect”. There is also a flexbox version
                    called Flexbox
                    froggy.
