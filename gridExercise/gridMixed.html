    <h1 class="title">The Road Not Taken</h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Robert Frost</h2>
    <p class="stanzaOne">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

    <p class="stanzaTwo"> Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        Though as for that the passing there<br>
        Had worn them really about the same,
    </p>

    <p class="stanzaThree">And both that morning equally lay<br>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
        I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

    <p class="stanzaFour">I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
        I took the one less traveled by,<br>
        And that has made all the difference.</p>
