       <p class="introPara">You have probably experienced a piece of bad UX writing whether it be a pop-up that vaguely
              insults you, an error
              message that didn’t actually tell you what is wrong, or an unsubscribe message that leaves you wondering

              you are actually unsubscribed. So <a href="https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/what-is-ux-writing/"

 ">CTA</span></li>
              <li><span class="popup" data-popuptext="They are usually short messages which aim to inform people about upcoming upgrades or any other activity in a product as well as provide some reminders to keep users engaged.The research shows that the notifications with less than 25 characters perform much better than long text.
 ">Notifications</span></li>
              <li><span class="popup" data-popuptext="An error message should be clear and helpful so that users could define the problem and what to do about it. A message needs to be polite and friendly to make users feel calm about the situation. In addition, a bit of humor could help annoyed users feel more relaxed and improve UX of a product. Still, you need to be careful adding jokes since it can be inappropriate or misunderstood in some situations.

">Errors</span></li>
