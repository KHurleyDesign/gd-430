        </section>


        <section id="excerpt">
            <p class="font-weightLight oxygen">I was on the brown plaid sofa, watching TV and scotch-taping my bangs to
                my
                forehead
                because
                Jeanette
                said
                that kept them from drying frizzy. Across the room on the Barcalounger, my mother was having her
                nervous breakdown.</p>

            <p class="paddingTop font-weightLight oxygen">Ma sat hunched over one of our fold-out TV trays, working
                constantly
                on a
                religious
                jigsaw puzzle
                without
                making any progress. She wore her knee socks and her quilted pink bathrobe, despite the early summer
                heat. She ate
                nothing but cubes of Kraft caramels. <span class="font-weightBold">For two weeks, I had been reaching
                    over and turning
                    up the
                    volume,
                    trying as best
                    I could to ignore the private curse words she'd begun chuckling to herself,</span> trying not to
                see
                the
                litter of caramel
                cellophane that was accumulating around her chair in a kind of half circle.</p>

            <p class="paddingTop font-weightLight oxygen">It wasn't that Ma hadn't put up a fight. In Daddy's absence,
                she'd
                repainted the
                downstairs
                hallway and
                exercised in front of the TV with Jack LaLanne and cried and kicked the lawn mower until it eventually
                started. Her
                efforts at going it alone led her back to Sunday Mass and through a succession of brief jobs:
                convalescent-home cook, bank
                teller, notions-department cleric at Mr. Big's discount store. When winter cold burst one of our pipes,
                Ma called
                and called until she located the random yellow-pages plumber who got out of bed to come fix it.</p>

            <p class="paddingTop font-weightBold oxygen">But we'd done nothing about maintaining the pool the previous
                fall.
                Leaves had
                fluttered down onto
                the
                surface then sunk and rotted; by springtime, the pool water was brown soup.</p>

            <p class="paddingTop font-weightLight oxygen">One morning in May, Ma went downstairs and found Petey dead
                at the
                bottom of his
                cage. "Why me?
                Why
                always
                me?'' she was still sobbing when I got home from school. She hadn't gone to work that day and didn't go
                the next day
                either. At the end of the week Mr. Big's called to say they were letting her go. By then she'd already
                begun living in
                her robe.</p>
