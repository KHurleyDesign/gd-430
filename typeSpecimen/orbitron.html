        <p id="descriptionOrbitron">Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. It
            features
            four
            weights (light, medium, bold, and black), a stylistic alternative, small caps, and a ton of alternate
            glyphs.
            Orbitron was designed so that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces like
            Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you have may noticed that all
            other fonts
            have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric
            typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate
            branding,
            uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for
            the
            movies portraying this inevitable future. It was initially published on the League of Movable Type.</p>
