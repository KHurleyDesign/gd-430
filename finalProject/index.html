        <h2 class="secThreeH2 secHeadStyle ">Why Vegetarian?</h2>
        <p class="secThreeP" id="bodyCopy">People become vegetarians for many reasons, including health, religious
            convictions,
            concerns about animal welfare or the use of antibiotics and hormones in livestock, or a desire to eat in a
            way that avoids excessive use of environmental resources. Some people follow a largely vegetarian diet
            because they can't afford to eat meat. Becoming a vegetarian has become more appealing and accessible,
            thanks to the year-round availability of fresh produce, more vegetarian dining options, and the growing
            culinary influence of cultures with largely plant-based diets. </p>

        <p class="secThreePTwo">Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional
            deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the
            health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally
            sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses. According to the American
            Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets,
            are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of
            certain diseases."</p>

        <p class="secThreePThree">You can get many of the health benefits of being vegetarian without going all the way.
            For example, a Mediterranean eating pattern — known to be associated with longer life and reduced risk of
            several chronic illnesses — features an emphasis on plant foods with a sparing use of meat. Even if you
            don't want to become a complete vegetarian, you can steer your diet in that direction with a few simple
            substitutions, such as plant-based sources of protein — beans or tofu, for example — or fish instead of meat
            a couple of times a week.</p>
