                And say how many Dew,
                Tell me how far the morning leaps—
                Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
                Who spun the breadth of blue!</p>

                In the new Robin's ecstasy
                Among astonished boughs—
                How many trips the Tortoise makes—
                How many cups the Bee partakes,
                The Debauchee of Dews!</p>

                Whose fingers string the stalactite—
                Who counts the wampum of the night
                To see that none is due?</p>

                With implements to fly away,
