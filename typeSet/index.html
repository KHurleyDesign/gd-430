            <blockquote>The answer to that question is a series of stories. We learn how few of the things we most
                value sprang from corporate labs or marketing departments. Mostly they came from people trying to solve
                a problem of their own, like the New Jersey cotton buyer with the injury-prone wife (the Band-Aid). The
                ground for this type of practical problem solving is more fertile than ever, says the technology
                theorist Clay Shirky who believes technology frees up our time and gives us the tools to use it more

            <h2>Ant Farm</h2>
            <address>By Paul Lukas</address>
            <p>Milton Levine was at a picnic one day in 1956 when the sight of some ants inspired him with this
                thought: He enjoyed watching ants on his uncle's farm as a child; other children would no doubt enjoy
                watching them, too. Within a few months, Levine, a toy salesman who specialized in mail- order
                novelties like toy soldiers and shrunken heads, and his brother-in- law, Joe Cossman, had a product.
                <span class="highlight"> Each ant “farm” kit included plastic housing, white sand for the ants to
                    tunnel in and a coupon for
                    consumers to redeem by mail for a vial of live ants. </span> After clearing some early hurdles —
                finding a glue
                that wouldn't kill the ants — the kit soon became the first massively popular ant farm, a hit with both
                teachers and children. By 2002, more than 20 million had been sold.</p>

            <h2>Band-Aid</h2>
            <address>By Susan Dominus</address>
            <p>Josephine Dickson, a New Jersey housewife prone to nicking herself in the kitchen, inspired her husband,
                Earle, a 28-year-old cotton buyer, to find an efficient way to protect her frequent injuries. <span
                    class="highlight">He took a
                    strip of gauze, laid it down on the sticky side of some surgical tape and over both laid a strip of
                    crinoline so the whole could be rolled up and not stick to itself. </span> Thereafter, whenever his
                wife cut
                herself, she could cut off a ready-made bandage, instead of having to resort to the standard remedy of
                1920: a strip of rag or gauze held in place with string. At the time, Dickson was working for Johnson &
                Johnson, which was already marketing sutures, bandages and hygiene products. He presented his
                innovation to higher-ups, who immediately recognized its utility. When Band-Aids did not sell well in
                their first year or two, the company started distributing them free of charge to a demographic that had
                an even greater need than housewives — Boy Scouts.</p>

            <h2>Bike Share</h2>
            <address>By Adam Sternbergh</address>
            <p>The central obstacle to bike-sharing programs has never been getting people to use the bikes — it's
                getting people to bring them back. This conundrum sank the first experimental urban bike-sharing
                program, a kind of utopian art prank undertaken in Amsterdam in 1965 by Luud Schimmelpennink and the
                anarchist group Provo, which scattered “White Bikes” around the streets for anyone to freely enjoy.
                Despite an inauspicious debut — the White Bikes were mostly stolen or trashed — the concept spread
                across Europe over the next 30 years, accompanied by innovations to ensure the return of the bikes:
                <span class="highlight"> deposits, annual memberships, tamper-resistant cycles, smart cards,
                    mobile-phone access.</span> The largest
                program in the U.S. now belongs to New York City, where CitiBike started in May, with 6,000 bikes
                stored at computer-controlled docking stations and available for short-term rentals, paid for by debit
                or credit cards.</p>

            <h2>Bottle Service</h2>
            <address>By Willy Staley</address>
            <p>Two promoters at the Tunnel in Chelsea, Mark Baker and Jeffrey Jah, changed the downtown club scene in
                New York in the early ‘90s by selling whole bottles of liquor at V.I.P. tables; they imported the
                notion from a club in Paris where Baker says bottles of Polish military vodka were passed off as
                brand-name booze. In other words, the price gouging has long been part of the idea, even before the
                1,000 percent markups, the 20 percent gratuities and the multi-thousand-dollar minimums to reserve
                tables. <span class="highlight">In its early days in New York, though, bottle service “was an amenity,
                    not a moneymaker,” </span>Jah
                says. A bottle was priced for the number of cocktails it could pour.</p>

            <h2>Digital Camera</h2>
            <address>By James Viahos</address>
            <p>Steve Sasson was the new guy at a Kodak research lab when his boss asked him to investigate a novel type
                of sensor called a charge-coupled device (C.C.D.). It was 1974, and the conversation lasted barely 20
                seconds. “This project would've been the least important one going on at that time,” Sasson says. A
                year later, <span class="highlight">armed with the prototype for what he called a “filmless camera,”
                    which was the size
                    of a
                    small toaster and weighed 8.5 pounds,</span> Sasson took a portrait of Joy, a woman who worked down
                the hall.
                The camera's C.C.D. used a grid of capacitors to measure the incoming photons of light and convert them
                into electrical signals. That technology wasn’t Sasson's invention. But he found a way to encode and
                permanently store the C.C.D. data and to use software to convert that data into a recognizable image
                that could be displayed on a Sony Trinitron television. “Needs work,” Joy said when the
                black-and-white, 100-by-100-pixel image of her came up on the screen. But Sasson was ecstatic.</p>

            <h2>Dog Park</h2>
            <address>By Jessica Gross</address>
            <p>When the City of Berkeley demolished a swath of houses in the late 1970s to build the Bay Area Rapid
                Transit system underground, residents began to gather in the space that had been cleared. Many of them
                were neighbors, who also brought their dogs, and before long a woman named Doris Richards encouraged
                the group to turn the space into a dog park. “There were ‘No Dogs’ signs all over the place,” Gail
                Green, part of that original cohort, says of Berkeley at the time. <span class="highlight"> “We needed
                    to have a place
                    to go and
                    let the dogs run.” </span> What started as an experimental dog park in 1979 became officially
                incorporated in
                1986.</p>

            <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
            <address>By Susan Dominus</address>
            <p>In the spring of 1964, a 25-year-old fashion illustrator in London named Barbara Hulanicki designed a
                pink gingham dress inspired by one in which Brigitte Bardot had been photographed. A friend of
                Hulanicki's, an editor at The Mirror who wanted to do a feature about inexpensive fashion, told her she
                would include the design as long as it cost no more than 25 shillings. Hulanicki agreed, <span class="highlight">and
                    within 24
                    hours of publication she received close to 4,000 orders. </span> That success paved the way for
                Biba, a
                store
                that Hulanicki and her husband opened in Kensington in the fall of that year. Biba pioneered the
                model
                of cheap, youthful designs, with a quick turnaround time and a steady supply of fresh inventory.
                “We
                had daily deliveries, like bagels,” Hulanicki, now an interior designer, says. Twiggy, a regular
                customer, helped make the mod designs a defining look of the era.</p>

            <h2>Glass Ceiling</h2>
            <address>By Robb Mandelbaum</address>
            <p>Eventually it would come to define how a generation of women viewed their working lives, but when
                Marilyn Loden used the expression extemporaneously at a Women’s Action Alliance conference in May 1978,
                she says it fell on deaf ears. Loden was a manager in New York Telephone’s human-resources department,
                where she had seen reams of company data showing that gender bias had stymied the careers of women
                there. <span class="highlight"> “I used to say that there are so many capable women here, and they’re
                    hitting their
                    heads on the
                    ceiling,” <span>she recalls today. Then, when she happened to be on that panel listening to relatively
                    powerful women repeat the conventional wisdom of the day, she says, she grew frustrated and
                    sharpened
                    her language. “Because we were talking about self-image and what you see in the mirror” — the
                    panel's
                    title was “Mirror, Mirror on the Wall” — “the whole glass metaphor kind of came to me. It's not
                    what we
                    see in ourselves but what we don't see. It's not what's in front of us, but what's above us.”</p>

            <h2>Guitar Solo</h2>
            <address>By David Marchese</address>
            <p>During the electric guitar's toddler days in the early 1930s, its players were largely tasked with
                carrying the rhythm while brass and reed instruments soloed in the spotlight. The Smithsonian credits
                Eddie Durham with the first amplified guitar solo on record — he spins some wry lines on the Jimmie
                Lunceford Orchestra’s 1935 swing number “Hittin’ the Bottle.” But it took Charlie Christian to advance
                the form toward its perpetual brash adolescence.</p>
            <p>Born in Bonham, Texas, in 1916, Christian came to fame in Benny Goodman's band, and his solos first
                appeared on records in 1939. Christian's spiraling choruses on “Stompin’ at the Savoy,” for example,
                <span class="highlight">crackle with the confidence of a musician unwilling to strum away behind a trumpeter. <span>“If you dropped
                Charlie Christian into the ‘60s,” G.E. Smith says, “he would've made music like Hendrix. He was that
                advanced.” Christian presaged the soloing guitar wizard in another more unfortunate way: He died young,
                from tuberculosis, when he was 25.</p>

                November 1901. “The combination is delicious, and, so far as I know, original.” <span class="highlight">This is the earliest
                reference to peanut butter and jelly,<span> and it appeared before the ingredients were widely available —
                you might have had to grind your own peanuts. It would be a while before the sandwich became a hit
                among those it's most associated with: children. That happened later, after peanut butter became
                available in jars in supermarkets and was marketed to children in the 1930s.</p>

            <address>By Dashka Slater</address>
            <p>Although senior proms were held at U.S. colleges in the late 1800s, it wasn't until after the turn of
                the century that the practice trickled into high schools,<span class="highlight"> gradually morphing from an ordinary banquet
                or tea dance into a gilded evening that mimicked the lavish coming-out parties of heiresses that
                dominated the society page <span>. Even the word sounded elegant, an abbreviation of “promenade,” the stately
                march guests once made at the start of formal parties, particularly debutante balls. The prom
                flourished in the ‘30s, went into hibernation during World War II and then re-emerged — bulked-up on
                postwar affluence and teenage culture — as the pricey all-night affair we know today. As a New York
                Times article explained in 1960, “High-school prom night ... is the night a boy becomes a man of the
                world and never stops spending.” Back then, parents fussed that prom-night costs could reach $75. This
                year, the average prom-going teenager racked up $1,139 in expenses.</p>

            <p>The first man-made climbing structure was designed by a Seattle Boy Scout leader and mountaineer, Clark
                Schurman, and completed by the W.P.A. in 1939. The first indoor wall <span class="highlight">designed to simulate holds
                encountered in rock climbing </span> was at the University of Leeds in England. A lecturer in the school's
                physical-education department, Don Robinson, noticed in 1964 that area rock climbers sustained a
                disproportionate number of injuries in the spring. Robinson attributed this to their habit of “spending
                most of the winter indoors, drinking beer.” A climber himself, he says, “I thought if I could make an
                artificial climbing structure, they'd climb on it in the winter and stay in shape.”</p>

            <address>By Susan Dominus</address>
            <p>Throughout the ‘70s, “Krazy” George Henderson, a rabid fan of San Jose State’s football team, regularly
                took it upon himself to rouse the students at home games. At his bidding, the first of three adjacent
                sections would stand, shout, “San!” then quickly sit down. The next two would follow with “Jose!” and
                “State!” When Henderson became a professional cheerleader and was hired by the Colorado Rockies hockey
                team at the end of the decade, he taught four sections of fans to cheer, “Go!” in quick succession. He
                says one evening, spontaneously, a fifth section followed, and was succeeded by another and another,
                until the cheer made its way all around the stadium. The world saw Henderson’s wave on Oct. 15, 1981,
                at a playoff game between the Oakland A’s and the New York Yankees. <span class="highlight">Henderson directed participating
                sections to boo those who didn't join in</span>, until everyone caught on and the wave rolled its way around
                the packed stadium, the first one caught on camera.</p>

            <h2>White Lab Coat</h2>
            <address>By Maggie Koerth-Baker</address>
            <p>Thomas Eakins’s 1875 painting of an operating theater, “The Gross Clinic,” depicts a doctor and his
                assistants dressed in stiff, black Victorian jackets, the same clothes you would expect them to wear on
                the streets of Philadelphia. Fourteen years later, Eakins painted another surgery in “The Agnew
                Clinic,” and this time the doctor wears the type of white smock we now associate with science and
                sterility. In the interval, <span class="highlight">medicine was becoming something that happened in laboratories, not just in
                doctor's offices</span>; by the late 19th century, doctors felt increased pressure to portray themselves as
                scientists because of the emergence of the germ theory of disease. So they traded their formal wear for
                the tan smocks that were long worn by chemists. Then came white coats — which signified purity — as
                sterilization came into vogue.</p>

            <h2>Zip Line</h2>
            <address>By Keith O'Brien</address>
            <p>In the early 1970s, Donald Perry was a graduate student studying the rain forests of Central America. To
                get closer to the treetops, he first climbed a rope, ascending inchworm-like; once in the canopy, about
                15 stories up, he then devised an intricate system of ropes and, later, steel cables that he slowly
                moved around on. “There was a whole continent of life up there, waiting to be investigated,” Perry
                says. “That was tremendously thrilling.”</p>
            <p>Perry wasn't the first to use a zip line. Its use dates back more than a century at least, as a means of
                crude transport across mountains and canyons. But his lines were different in that they attracted the
                press and then, later, tourists. <span class="highlight">Perry himself recognized the economic potential of zip lines, opening
                the Rain Forest Aerial Tram in 1994. </span> Others followed, first in Central America, then in the U.S., and
                within a decade zip lines became a big business. There are more than 600 large-scale zip-line tour
                operations in the U.S. and Canada, Michael R. Smith, the managing partner of ArborTrek Canopy
                Adventures, says. By the end of the year, he estimates, it will be a $770 million industry.</p>
